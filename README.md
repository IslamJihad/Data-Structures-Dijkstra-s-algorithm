# Data-Structures-Dijkstra-s-algorithm
In this project you will implement a solution of a very common issue: how  to get from one town to another using the shortest route. You will design a solution that will let you find the shortest paths between  two input points in a graph, representing cities and towns, using Dijkstraâ€™s  algorithm. Your program should allow the user to enter the input file  containing information of roads connecting cities/towns. The program  should then construct a graph based on the information provided from the  file. The user should then be able to enter pairs of cities/towns and the  algorithm should compute the shortest path between the two cities/towns  entered.
